## General description

This repository contains the source code for the front-end prototype of the Hypermedia Web Application course A.Y. 2017/2018 of the Cannas-Randazzo-Vaghi team. The project consists of a web site of a fictional onlus named **Abilitiamoci**, which offers support services to children and young adults affected by mental and physical disabilities, along with their families. The website aims at showing the different services the association offers, the people involved in providing them and the locations where the users can benefit from those services.

### Contributing

The website presents a common graphic layout for all the pages, which has been developed by the team before the division of work.
Since the developement of pages presented a very similar workflow, our team chose to work in parallel in order to allow each member to go in depth in all the aspects of a page developement (such as template components choice, custom css modifications, script insertion, etc..).

## Template used

We used the following template: http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0F82581, which is based on HTML5 and Bootstrap 4.

## External scripts and plugins

The main scripts exploited are the ones involved in the pages animations (components, sliders, menus etc), which were arleady included in the template we have used, and can be found in the assets/plugins folder. The only other external script we used, was the one provided by Google for the Map visualization: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map, which is directly included inside the pages that required it. 

## Developement issues

The main problems we faced during the development derived from the fact that, since we used the template just as a library for the graphical components for our pages, the adaptation and customization of the single graphical elements has been sometimes a little annoying. Beside this, the main other development issue has been the right use of the external plugins, expecially the Google Maps script.
